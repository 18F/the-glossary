    longform: Firm fixed-price contract
    description: |
      Provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor’s cost  experience in performing the contract, therefore it pays the contractor a fixed amount. This type  of contract is used for acquiring supplies or services when there are reasonably definite  functional or detailed specifications, and the contracting officer can establish a fair and  reasonable price at the time of contract award. This type of contract places upon the contractor  the maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides the  maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a  minimal administrative burden upon the contracting parties.
