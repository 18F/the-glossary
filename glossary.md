### Terms & Definitions

**<a name="1102"></a>[1102](#1102)** \
Federal Government job series number for procurement personnel
**<a name="8(a)"></a>[8(a)](#8(a))** \
Also known as the 8(a) Business Development Program, Section 8(a) authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into all types of contracts with other agencies and let subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. The SBA's subcontractors are referred to as "8(a) contractors."
**<a name="abilityone"></a>[AbilityOne](#abilityone)** \
AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) provides employment opportunities for over 40,000 Americans who are blind or have other severe disabilities by orchestrating government purchases of products and services provided by nonprofit agencies employing such individuals throughout the country.
**<a name="acquisition"></a>[Acquisition](#acquisition)** \
The acquiring by contract with appropriated funds of supplies or services (including construction)  by and for the use of the Federal Government through purchase or lease, whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be created, developed, demonstrated, and evaluated.  Acquisition begins at the point when agency needs are established and includes the description of requirements to satisfy agency needs, solicitation and selection of sources, award of contracts, contract financing, contract performance, contract administration, and those technical and management functions directly related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract.
**<a name="acquisition-plan"></a>[Acquisition plan](#acquisition-plan)** (AP) \
An Acquisition Plan is a plan that documents all cost, schedule, technical, business, management, and other considerations that will govern an acquisition program and is derived from the Acquisition Strategy. It summarizes the acquisition planning discussions and identifies milestones in the acquisition process. A comprehensive plan for fulfilling the agency need in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost, it includes developing the overall strategy for managing the acquisition.
**<a name="acquisition-planning"></a>[Acquisition planning](#acquisition-planning)** \
The process by which the efforts of all personnel responsible for an acquisition are coordinated and integrated through a comprehensive plan for fulfilling the agency need in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. It includes developing the overall strategy for managing the acquisition.
**<a name="acquisition-workforce"></a>[Acquisition workforce](#acquisition-workforce)** \
Program Managers, Project Managers, Procurement Technicians, Procurement Clerks, most CORs, and all personnel that are neither Contract Specialists nor certified Contracting Officers.
**<a name="alternative-dispute-resolution"></a>[Alternative dispute resolution](#alternative-dispute-resolution)** (ADR) \
'ADR includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that fall outside of the government judicial process. Despite historic resistance to ADR by both parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually mediation, before permitting the parties'' cases to be tried. The rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation and provides greater confidentiality. FAR 33.214 discusses ADR.'
**<a name="agency-ethics-official"></a>[Agency Ethics Official](#agency-ethics-official)** (AEO) \
_No definition provided._

**<a name="aggregate-award-of-all-line-items-to-one-contractor"></a>[Aggregate award of all line items to one contractor](#aggregate-award-of-all-line-items-to-one-contractor)** \
Awarding all line items to a single contractor is usually appropriate when suppliers sell the contract items as an integrated unit.
**<a name="allocable"></a>[Allocable](#allocable)** \
A cost is properly allocable to a contract if it is incurred specifically for the contract or is incurred for another activity that also benefits the contract. With regard to the allocability of costs claimed, the COR must look for any direct costs that appear to have no connection with the contract work.  If the COR cannot understand why the contractor would need billed materials or effort to perform the contract, then the costs may have been charged to the contract in error.
**<a name="anti-deficiency-act"></a>[Anti-Deficiency Act](#anti-deficiency-act)** \
The Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits Government officials and employees from obligating or spending more money than has been made available by OMB, their agency, and the Finance Office.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub L. 111-5), is an economic stimulus package enacted by the 111th United States Congress in February 2009. The Act was intended to provide a stimulus to the U.S. economy in the wake of the economic downturn. The measures are nominally worth $787 billion. The Act includes federal tax cuts, expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions, and domestic spending in education, health care, and infrastructure, including the energy sector. The Act also includes numerous non-economic recovery related items that were either part of longer-term plans (e.g. a study of the effectiveness of medical treatments) or desired by Congress (e.g. a limitation on executive compensation in federally aided banks). The ARRA is much larger than the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which consisted primarily of tax rebate checks.
**<a name="authority-to-operate"></a>[Authority to Operate](#authority-to-operate)** (ATO) \
An ATO is an authorization approved by an Authorizing Official (AO) who accepts a system’s security risk. We say “ATO process” as shorthand.

A cost-reimbursement contract that provides for the initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.

The formula provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.
