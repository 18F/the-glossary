Please fill in the following information to add a new term to the glossary. If you want to add multiple terms, copy the below list for each separate term. (See the bottom of this issue for an example.)

- **Term:** Write out the full term, using the appropriate capitalization. This is usually sentence case, unless it's a term that has an acronym/initialism.
- **Acronym:** If this term has an acronym, write it here. Otherwise, delete this line.
- **Description:** Write a definition for this term. The recommendation is to have it be detailed enough to be useful, and written in plain enough language and with enough context so that someone new to this term can either understand it or has enough information to do further research.
